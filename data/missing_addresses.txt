Welcome to your next home in the heart of Sage Creek! This fully finished 1,360 sqft bungalow is tucked away on a
quiet street, just steps from the brand new school currently under construction — talk about location! Step inside to
an open-concept main floor with soaring vaulted ceilings & a sun-soaked, south-facing living room that floods the
space with natural light. The kitchen is a total win — tons of counter and cupboard space, built-in wine storage, & a
great breakfast bar for your morning coffee or evening catch-ups. The primary suite is oversized and offers a WIC &
ensuite. There's also a private den that could easily be converted back into a fourth bdrm if you need the space.
Downstairs is where the fun happens — a fully finished basement with a massive rec room, two bars (yes, two —
one wet, one dry), plus a wired entertainment zone with an incl projector screen for epic movie nights or big game
days. Enjoy central A/C, custom window coverings, an alarm system, all appliances included, a fully landscaped &
fenced yard, & both front & rear decks to soak up the sun. Toss in the attached dbl garage and this place checks all
the boxes.
